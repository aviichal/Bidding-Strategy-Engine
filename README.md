# Bidding-Strategy-Engine
Designed a bidding strategy prediction engine to recommend actionable strategies such as increasing, reducing, or pausing bids based on performance metrics like clicks, spend, and orders. Implemented a data preprocessing pipeline, feature scaling, and Random Forest Classification for decision-making. Developed a Tkinter-based GUI for interactive file loading and bid prediction. The model dynamically evaluates clicks, spend, and orders to optimize advertising campaigns, saving predictions and summaries to Excel files for further analysis. â€“ Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Tkinter, Joblib.
